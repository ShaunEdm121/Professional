      <h2>Hello.</h2>

      <br>
      <p class="intro1">I have been a professional and dependable support specialist with experience in the technical and administrative fields for over a decade.</p>
      <p>I have an advanced proficiency with MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams and others office related programs.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Over the past 5 years, I have worked with the setup, design and debugging of several consumer based web sites in a ecommerce environment. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I am currently expanding my understanding of
          Bootstrap.</p>
        <p> I put my skills to use developing a site to celebrate the marrigae to my beautiful wife. Feel free to to take a look yourself by clicking <a href="https://www.meirieleandshaunwedding.com">here</a></p>

      <div class="skill-row-communication">
        <img class="communcation" src="images/communication2.png" alt="Communication">
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p class="communication-text">Communication is the first step in understanding and connecting with people. Regardsless of the field you are in, all of us must be able to deliver our thoughts and ideas in the most affective way possible.
          This is why I have made it a point to focus on how what I have conveying to someone is being delivered and how it is recieved. All of us are different and precieve the world differently.</p>
        <p>I have learned to adapt and change not only what I am saying but how that information is conveyed in the best and most approprite way possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row-critical">
        <img class="critical" src="images/critical thinking.png" alt="Critical Thinking">
        <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
        <p>Each of us has an idea of how the world should work. Some of us may not agree with those particular views. For me, the point of critical thinking is to focus on the few or many grains that make up an idea.</p>
        <p>While the concept as a whole may not be viable, the key is to find those morsels of brilliance and incorporate them in to your own.</p>
        <p>The next step is to ask the questions that those grains do not answer and keep asking them until the solution becomes clear.
          If you can include as many people as you can and thus more concepts and ideas, the road to a solution is expedited exponentially.</p>

      <div class="skill-row-adaptability">
        <img class="adaptability" src="images/adaptability4.png" alt="Adaptability">
        <h3>Adaptability and Learning</h3>
        <p>Much of life can't be predicted. A lot of the goals we set out to do rarely end the way we thought they would. The best idea is to remain flexible while achieving the objective.</p>
        <p>I have always been able to adapt and change as the task requires it. It happens to be one of my points of pride.</p>
        <p>On several occasions I have been asked to do something I have never done before or to acquire a skill I have never used before.</p>
        <p>Each time I have taken it upon myself to learn quickly and to get the job done.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="skill-row-Leadership">
        <img class="leadership" src="images/leadership.png" alt="Leadership">
        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>Leadership is not the ability to take command. Leadership is the ability to create and inspire focus.</p>
        <p>Rome wasn't built in a day and it most certainly was not built by one person. I believe a true leader is a person that can look at the resources that they have at their disposal and organize those resources for the benefit of achieving a
          goal. </p>
        <p>Much of what I refer to as resources are people. Having the ability to focus many different minds with many different ideas and methods on how things should be done and align them towards a common purpose is the true essence of leadership.
        </p>
        <p> When I am offered the opportunity to take charge, I focus on the people and creating a team. As a guide I show that team how to best utilize their potential and skills for the benefit of everyone.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row-creative">
        <img class="creative" src="images/creative2.png" alt="Creative">
        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p>I like to express my creativity through my web design, drawing, writing and other outlets but I do know having a creative mindset is an asset in the workplace.</p>
        <p>Finding solutions to problems can be difficult but what if you have attempted one or multiple potential solutions without getting the results you want?</p>
        <p>Being creative allows me to see options that may not be apparent to others.
          Many times I have been the person in the meeting that made that suggestion or had the idea that simply wasn't obvious to anyone else.</p>
